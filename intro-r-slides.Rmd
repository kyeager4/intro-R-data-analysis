# What is R? | And why you should use it

## About R <img src="./images/Rlogo.png" width="20%" style="float: right;">

- What it is: Free and open source statistical software and statistical programming language
- Cost: Free!
- Operating systems: Windows, Mac, Linux
- To install: [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/)

## The R user interface


<img src="./images/r_ui_labeled.png" width="100%" style="border: 1px solid #000000;">

- The **console** is the "command line" interface part of R -- type code into it, press enter, get results back
- The console is fine for "playing around", but most of the time, you'll put everything into an **R script** -- a file containing executable R code

## Why use R?

- Free and open-source
- Reproducibility and _literate statistical programming_ (combining written report with the code used to generate tables, figures, analysis)
- Beautiful, publication-quality graphics (especially ggplot2)
- Frequently the first place to find new and cutting-edge statistical methods (even before they're available in big-name stat software programs)
- Large and active user community
    - Better free tutorials
    - Active forums, social media community for seeking help
    - Opportunities to promote yourself professionally


## About RStudio <img src="./images/RStudio-Logo-Flat.png" width="30%" style="float: right;">

- Completely optional but can make writing R code much easier!
- What it is: Interactive development environment (IDE) for R
  - View objects in your R environment
  - Syntax highlighting and auto-completion features
  - Keyboard shortcuts for writing code
  - And much, much more
- Requires R to work -- can't be used without first installing R
- Cost: Free
- Operating systems: Windows, Mac, Linux
- To install: [rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

## The RStudio User Interface

<img src="./images/rstudio_ui_labeled.png" width="100%" style="border: 1px solid #000000;">

## The R Workflow

1. Obtain data and set up project directory
2. Read/import data into R
3. Data management
    - Check data quality
    - Compute new variables
    - Filter rows
    - Select columns
4. Data analysis
    - Descriptive statistics
    - Plots
    - Statistical tests and models

## Anatomy of a dataset - Data structure

<center><img src="./images/dataset-structure-excel.png" width="70%" style="border: 1px solid #000000;"></center>

- First row contains variable names (no spaces or special characters; numbers, periods, underscores OK; R is case-sensitive)
- Rows = observations (1 row = 1 respondent or unit)
- Columns = variables (1 column = 1 distinct variable)

## Objects & Environment

- **Objects** are named "things" you've created in R -- can be manipulated, modified, plotted, etc.
- Objects are created using the assignment operator: `<-`

Example: Create a new object called `new_object` whose value is equal to a constant:
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
new_object <- 10
```

There are different types of objects in R -- in this session, we'll be focusing on **dataframes** and **vectors**

## Objects & Environment
- The **environment** is the collection of all R objects that have been defined during the current session <img src="./images/example-r-environment-rstudio.png" width="60%" style="border: 1px solid #000000; float: right;">
- If you're using RStudio, you can view all objects in the Environment panel 
- The environment is normally cleared when you close R, but you can choose to save the environment so it still exists the next time you launch R (normally not recommended)


## Functions and arguments

- R syntax is generally driven by **functions**, which are pre-programmed tasks that R can do
- Most (but not all) functions have **arguments** that can modify or control the behavior of the function

Example: Compute the mean of a variable
```{r eval=FALSE}
mean(x=mydata$SleepTime, na.rm=TRUE)
```

- `mean()` is the name of the function
- `x` and `na.rm` are arguments of `mean()`
    - `x` is the vector of data to compute the mean of
    - `na.rm=TRUE` tells R to ignore any missing values in the input vector


## Functions and arguments

- You can open a function's documentation page using the function `help()`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
help("mean")
help("read.csv")
```


## R packages

- R packages are user-created modules of code intended to fulfill a narrow task or purpose
- Shared through repositories, of which CRAN is "main" one
    - See [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) to explore R packages by topic
- An R user "installs" an R package from the online repository to their local package directory using the function `install.packages()`
- Once a package has been installed, it can be used in your R scripts -- simply load the package using `library()`



# Worked Example

## Today's sample data

Tutorial sample data:

- Simulated survey dataset we use for our online tutorials
- n=435 "college students"
- Available in CSV, TXT, SAS, SPSS formats
- Download from our website: [libguides.library.kent.edu/SPSS/](https://libguides.library.kent.edu/SPSS/) ([direct download link for CSV](https://libguides.library.kent.edu/ld.php?content_id=60015812))

Research questions we'll consider today:

- Do students who study more get less sleep? (Or: do students who sleep more study less?)
- Do underclassmen (freshmen and sophomores) get less sleep than upperclassmen (juniors and seniors)?

# Working in R, part 0 | Before you open the program

## Set up your project

Create a project folder on your computer with the following subdirectories:

- project
   - code
   - data [raw]
   - data ["processed"]
   - plots
   - output
   - reports

## RStudio Projects

- Reason to do this: Can declare a folder/directory on your computer as an "RStudio project"
- Allows you to read and write files using relative paths instead of absolute paths

Example: Absolute file path on Windows: <br/> `"C:/Users/yourusername/yourprojectfolder/data/mydata.csv"`

Example: Absolute file path on Mac: <br/> `"/Users/yourusername/yourprojectfolder/data/mydata.csv"`


Example: Relative file path after creating an RStudio project in the "yourprojectfolder" folder: <br/>
`"data/mydata.csv"`

# Working in R, part 1 | Importing text-based data

## Step 1: Get data into R

- _**Data frames**_ are R's object type for traditional "data sets"
- Base R function to import text and CSV files as a data frame: `read.table` or `read.csv`

```{r}
mydata <- read.csv(file="data/Sample_Dataset_2014.csv")
```

This code creates an object named `mydata` containing the data from this file as a data frame.


## Step 2: Look at the data we imported into R

How do we know if our import was successful?

The following functions take a data frame as an argument, and return previews or summaries about that data frame:

- View the dataframe as a spreadsheet using `View(mydata)`
- Print variable types using function `str(mydata)` (str is short for **str**ucture)
- Print minimum, maximum, median, missing values for all variables in dataframe using `summary(mydata)`
- Print first 5 rows of dataframe using `head(mydata)`
- Print last 5 rows of dataframe using `tail(mydata)`
- Print names of variables in dataframe using `names(mydata)`

## Tip

Never use the `attach()` function, even if you see it in an online tutorial and it looks like it would make things easier.


## Step 3: Access variables within our dataset

- Variables are a named component of our dataframe
- Some functions expect a dataframe; other functions expect a _vector_ of observations -- that is, a single, specific column from a dataframe

When we need to access a column of a dataframe as a vector, we use the `$` operator:

```{r eval=FALSE}
mydata$varname
```

This syntax can be combined with the assignment operator to add new variables to a dataframe, or edit existing variables in a dataframe:

```{r eval=FALSE}
mydata$varname_times_ten <- mydata$varname*10
```

## Step 4: Access rows within our dataset

Normally when we want to access specific rows, what we really want is to filter our data by some condition. We can do this using function `subset()`:

```{r}
freshmen_only <- subset(mydata, Rank==1)
```

The first argument to `subset` is the name of the dataframe. The second argument is a **logical condition** for which rows to keep (here, `Rank==1`, i.e. keep only freshman).


# Working in R, part 2 | Summary statistics

## Summary statistics for continuous numeric variables

- `mean()`, `sd()`, `min()`, `max()`, `median()`, `sum()`
    - The `na.rm=TRUE` argument
- Base R graphics: `hist()`, `boxplot()`

## Summary statistics for categorical variables

- `table()`
- `prop.table()`
- Base R graphics: `barplot(table(...))`

# Working in R, part 3 | Installing an R package for plotting

## Installing package ggplot2

- The ggplot2 package creates beautiful, publication-quality graphics using the _grammar of graphics_ syntax
- To install the package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

## Loading package ggplot2

After you've installed the package, you can load the package whenever you want to use it:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

We typically put these package loading statements at the start of our scripts.

# Working in R, part 4 | Data analysis

## Examples

- Correlation using `cor`
- Scatterplot using `ggplot2`
- Linear regression using `lm()`
